* The print title is in the `title` tag.
* A book does not necessarily have parts as a structure.
* A part is started with an empty page on the right hand side. 
* Parts also appear in the table of content

Parts in the Booktype table of contents which start with '###' are not printed in the book.
These parts contain special information to structure the book (better).
